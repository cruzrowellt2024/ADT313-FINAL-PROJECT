# ADT313-FINAL-PROJECT

# Reminder
- Client Page is included inside the pages together with Main(Admin) and Public(Login and Register) instead of separate project.
- To Login and Register as User, use localhost:3000/ and localhost:3000/register for url.
- To Login and Register as Admin, use localhost:3000/admin and localhost:3000/admin/register for url.
- Photos PATCH method does not work properly.
- Update time of tables for Casts, Videos, and Photos Components depends on data(My database has only 8 movies but full of information).
- Buggy login interface design, like Email and Password label being black instead of white font color.
- Movie Creation button is included in Movie Page instead of List Component for accessibility even on edit mode of other movies.
- Movie Creation button uses ButtonContext to keep the toggling mode, Create New : Back.
- Creating New Movie while on editing mode will keep the details for convinience like duplication of Movie with different data but still changable on search bar.
- Featured Movies on Client Side works fine.
- Admin Dashboard does not have any content.
- Instead of Side Bar, I use header for Menu(Dashboard and Movies), Website Name, and Logout Button.
